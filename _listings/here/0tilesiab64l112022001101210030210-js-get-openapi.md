      summary: Traffic Incidents via Proximity
      description: |-
        *Request traffic incident information within specified area*

        Traffic incidents can be retrieved through several different request types, based on the addressing schemes that they use to specify their geography. Traffic requests can be output to either XML or JSON format. API also supports filters to limit the amount of information provided in the response. Filters are based on on status, criticality, TMC table IDs, profiles, or start and end times, etc.



        * **prox**  `prox`
         \- A type of spatial filter. Proximity specifies a circle to search using a latitude, a longitude, and a radius in meters.    e.g. `52.515,13.377,100`

        * **criticality**  `multi-enum`
         \- A filter that selects incident reports according to criticality,  `0`=critical, `1`=major, `2`=minor,  `3`=lowImpact

         Valid values are : `0` - critical, `1` - major, `2` - minor, `3` - lowImpact
